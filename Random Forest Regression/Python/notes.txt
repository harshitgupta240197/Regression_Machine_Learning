Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other
tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

Random forest is a supervised algorithm that uses ensemble learning to solve classification and regression tasks. 

Ensemble learning is a process that combines multiple models to solve complex problems and improve model performance. 

Random forest uses this process by creating many decision trees during training, and then taking the average of their 
outputs to improve the predictive accuracy of the dataset.
